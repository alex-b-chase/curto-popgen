# Bacterial Species Definition
To do so, we defined a bacterial species using the ecotype framework or a cluster of closely-related strains with the same ecological niche. For a more in-depth framework, please read the exeptional perspective by [Rocha. MBE. 2019.](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/35/6/1338/4976545)

## *Curtobacterium*
Within *Curtobacterium*, we previously conducted a thorough investigation into the environmental resources driving niche partitioning along a regional climate gradient.

>Our results revealed that cultured isolates separated into fine‐scale genetic clusters that reflected distinct suites of phenotypic traits, denoting the existence of multiple ecotypes.
>
>Functional traits assayed to delineate ecotypes: growth, biofilm formation and depolymerization of xylan and cellulose. All assays were further assessed along a temperature gradient.
>
>Six abundant ecotypes were observed with differential abundances along the gradient, suggesting fine‐scale niche partitioning.

For this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity within a single ecotype, Subclade IB/C
